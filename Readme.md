**Note:** this repository is archived.

When I started this project, I was deeply involved with both Minecraft
and JavaScript. Since then, my involvement with both has waned and the
JavaScript landscape has moved at an incredible pace.

Without a clear vision and no dogfooding, I'm no longer the right
maintainer for this project and hence have archived this repository.
There are a good few forks out there which I encourage anyone to seek
out and give a try.

Apologetically yours,

NBT.js [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sjmulder/nbt-js.png)](https://travis-ci.org/sjmulder/nbt-js)
======

By Sijmen Mulder and a host of wonderful contributors.

NBT.js is a JavaScript parser and serializer for [NBT](http://wiki.vg/NBT)
archives, for use with [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) or the browser.


Usage
-----

After `var nbt = require('nbt')` or `<script src="nbt.js"></script>`, you can
use `nbt.parse(data, callback)` to convert NBT data into a regular JavaScript
object.

```js
var fs = require('fs'),
    nbt = require('nbt');

var data = fs.readFileSync('fixtures/bigtest.nbt.gz');
nbt.parse(data, function(error, data) {
    if (error) { throw error; }

    console.log(data.value.stringTest.value);
    console.log(data.value['nested compound test'].value);
});
```

If the data is gzipped, it is automatically decompressed first. When running
in the browser, `window.zlib` or [`window.pako`](https://github.com/nodeca/pako/) is required for this to work.

Tag names are copied verbatim, and as some names are not valid JavaScript
names, use of the indexer may be required â€“ such as with the nested
compound test in the example above.
